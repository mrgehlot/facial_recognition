# Simple Facial Recognizer üöÄ

[![Made with Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://streamlit.io/)

A modern, real-time facial recognition pipeline built with Python. This project leverages the high-performance **MediaPipe** for face detection, **`keras-facenet`** for generating accurate facial embeddings, **ChromaDB** for efficient vector storage and search, and **Streamlit** for creating interactive web applications.

It's designed to be simple to set up and use, providing a solid foundation for various computer vision projects, from smart home security to personalized user experiences.

## üìÇ Project Components

Each file in this project serves a specific purpose, creating a modular and understandable pipeline.

| File                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `create_dataset.py`   | An interactive Streamlit app to build your face dataset. Enter a name, and capture images directly from your webcam. The images are saved into the `face_images` directory.                           |
| `data_loader.py`      | Processes the images in `face_images/`. It uses **MediaPipe** to detect faces, generates high-quality embeddings with **`keras-facenet`**, and stores them in a **ChromaDB** vector database.         |
| `facial_recognizer.py`| The main real-time recognition app. It captures video from your webcam, detects faces, and identifies them by querying the vector database for the closest match.                                     |
| `query_database.py`   | A utility app to test the recognition pipeline by uploading a single image. It will detect faces in the image and show the closest matches found in the database.                                     |
| `data_viewer.py`      | A simple tool to inspect the contents of your ChromaDB vector database. It helps you see the IDs and metadata of the faces you have stored.                                                          |
| `utils.py`            | A helper script that automatically downloads the required `blaze_face` detection model from MediaPipe on the first run, ensuring you have the necessary files without manual downloads.              |
| `requirements.txt`    | Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.                                                                                                                                          |


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage Guide

Follow these steps to get the facial recognition system up and running.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrgehlot/facial_recognition.git
cd facial_recognition
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*The required face detection model will be downloaded automatically the first time you run any of the apps.*

### Step 3: Create Your Facial Dataset

Run the dataset creation app. Enter a name for each person and capture a few images.

```bash
streamlit run create_dataset.py
```

### Step 4: Load Faces into the Database

Run the data loader script. This will process all images in the `face_images` folder and create your vector database.

```bash
python data_loader.py
```

### Step 5: Run the Facial Recognizer!

Launch the main application to see the real-time recognition in action.

```bash
streamlit run facial_recognizer.py
```

## üí° Potential & Use Cases

This project is a great starting point for many exciting applications. Here are a few ideas:

- **üè† Smart Home Automation:** Grant access to your home or specific rooms only to authorized users. Trigger personalized scenes (e.g., lighting, music) when a specific family member is detected.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Personalized Experiences:** Imagine a smart mirror that shows your personal calendar, news feed, or weather forecast when you look at it.
- **üè¢ Automated Attendance Systems:** Track student or employee attendance automatically, saving time and reducing manual errors.
- **üîí Enhanced Security:** Create a simple security system that logs unrecognized faces or sends an alert when an unknown person is detected in a restricted area.
- **üé® Interactive Art Installations:** Build an art piece that reacts differently based on who is viewing it.

## üíª Technology Stack
